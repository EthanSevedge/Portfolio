I developed this structure as an assignment for a programming class I took in 2022. It defines the Library, Person, and Book objects and related methods to instantiate and manipulate them to check out books, return books, print available books, etc. CSV files are used to define each Library's Catalog as an array of Books. The program main.py runs through examples of how the Library methods work and what errors they produce if used incorrectly.
