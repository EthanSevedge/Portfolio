Hello! My name is Ethan Sevedge, and I am a developing programmer with the most experience in Java and Python, though I dabble in bash and batch scripting as well. This is a small sample of the various programs I have written over the years, for classes or for personal enjoyment/utility. Hope you enjoy!
